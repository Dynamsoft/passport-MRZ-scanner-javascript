# About the solution

Passport MRZ Scanner enables camera to scan the MRZ code of a passport. It will extract all data like firstname, lastname, passport number, nationality, date of birth, expiration date and personal numer from the MRZ string, and converts the encoded string into human-readable fields. Welcome to visit dynamsoft's [official website](https://dynamsoft.com/capture-vision/docs/web/programming/javascript/user-guide/passport-mrz-scanner.html) to learn more about this solution.

## System Requirements

This project requires the following features to work:

- Secure context (HTTPS deployment)

  When deploying your application / website for production, make sure to serve it via a secure HTTPS connection. This is required for two reasons
  
  - Access to the camera video stream is only granted in a security context. Most browsers impose this restriction.
  > Some browsers like Chrome may grant the access for `http://127.0.0.1` and `http://localhost` or even for pages opened directly from the local disk (`file:///...`). This can be helpful for temporary development and test.
  
  - Dynamsoft License requires a secure context to work.

- `WebAssembly`, `Blob`, `URL`/`createObjectURL`, `Web Workers`

  The above four features are required for the SDK to work.

- `MediaDevices`/`getUserMedia`

  This API is required for in-browser video streaming.

- `getSettings`

  This API inspects the video input which is a `MediaStreamTrack` object about its constrainable properties.

The following table is a list of supported browsers based on the above requirements:

  | Browser Name |     Version      |
  | :----------: | :--------------: |
  |    Chrome    | v78+<sup>1</sup> |
  |   Firefox    | v63+<sup>1</sup> |
  |     Edge     |       v79+       |
  |    Safari    |       v14+       |

  <sup>1</sup> devices running iOS needs to be on iOS 14.3+ for camera video streaming to work in Chrome, Firefox or other Apps using webviews.

Apart from the browsers, the operating systems may impose some limitations of their own that could restrict the use of the SDK. Browser compatibility ultimately depends on whether the browser on that particular operating system supports the features listed above.
